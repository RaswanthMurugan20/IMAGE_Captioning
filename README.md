# Image-captioning
There are 2 models for Captioning

Model without Attention(Basic):- 
Image captioning models trained using Encoder-Decoder Rnn and Lstm. The features of the images used as input have been extracted from a VGG-16 Convolutional Neural Network.   

Model with Attention(Attention):
This model uses the Attention model as described in the Show,Attend and Tell paper (arXiv:1502.03044). The model InceptionV3 is used to preprocess the images which is then fed into the Cnn endcoder.
